# Jerry's Justice Vault
  Jerry Justice Vault is a full-stack application  dedicated to empowering underserved and minority communities by providing affordable and accessible legal aid resources. Our mission is to bridge the gap in legal       accessibility by offering a user-friendly and comprehensive hub where individuals can find information, tools, and support for their legal cases.
  We believe in justice for all, regardless of socioeconomic status, and strive to create a world where no one is left behind due to the lack of resources or representation. Through innovation, empathy, and a            commitment to equity, we aim to make the pursuit of justice attainable for everyone.
